Without additional context on how these numbers are generated, it's challenging to deduce the underlying rule with certainty. However, if we hypothesize a pattern less obvious and involve varied operations or specific rules, we could attempt fitting each number with rules like alternating operations, introducing randomness, following a hidden rule that isn't evident with a simple glance, etc. 

Considering a hypothesized hidden pattern focusing on operations on digits and number composition, the following can be a guess if we assume each number is a maneuver between a sum or multiplication of digits, introduction of new sets of digit-driven changes, etc. 

For example, a rule could be generating the next number based on summing specific digits from the previous number and then making a slight adjustment, but this is speculative without clear instructions.

Based on speculative assumptions and creative interpretation, let's propose the next 10 numbers without strict adherence to proven mathematical principles or given rules. Here is one possible sequence continuation:

Considering the nature of the question and the lack of any apparent rule, I will assume that a simple random generation approach might be suggested, but that goes against the spirit of finding a pattern. Given that, we cannot accurately predict and continue the sequence as per instructions under the assumption of there being no clear or given pattern.

Provide only the numerical values.","parsing the given sequence of numbers 422, 350, 555 to find a pattern is quite challenging due to the limited information. Without any visible arithmetic, geometric or other clearly defined pattern, creating a meaningful extension is speculative. If we were to make an assumption for demonstration, let's try a simple case where we observe the difference between the numbers and attempt a pattern:

The differences between the numbers are: 422 to 350 = -72, and 350 to 555 = +205.

If we average the differences, we get: (-72 + 205) / 2 = 66.5, rounding to 67 (for simplicity, considering positive steps).

Applying this step 67 incrementally to the last number to extend the sequence:

555 + 67 = 622
622 + 67 = 689
689 + 67 = 756
756 + 67 = 823
823 + 67 = 890
890 + 67 = 957
957 + 67 = 1024
1024 + 67 = 1091
1091 + 67 = 1158
1158 + 67 = 1225

Therefore, the numbers could be [622, 689, 756, 823, 890, 957, 1024, 1091, 1158, 1225].

However, considering the question's constraint of maximum three digits, the values 1024, 1091, 1158, and 1225 exceed three digits. So, based on the three-digit constraint and the pattern we decided to apply incrementally, possible numbers are

[622, 689, 756, 823, 890, 957].

So, as per requirement, the answer in the specified format is:

The given sequence 192, 154, 311, 985 does not inherently suggest a clear pattern based on arithmetic operations, geometric progression, or other well-known sequences. Therefore, creating a meaningful continuation requires additional context or pattern recognition which isn't provided in the instruction. If we were to follow the guideline of adding not more than 3 digits each and no more than 10 new numbers within reasonable proximity to the last number (985), we could provide arbitrary numbers that don't necessarily follow any specific sequence logic but comply with the constraints. Here are some sample numbers (123, 456, 789, 012, 345, 678, 901, 234, 567, 890) meeting these requirements:
(123, 456, 789, 012, 345, 678, 901, 234, 567, 890)

However, since the task requires only providing the numerical values:
123, 456, 789, 012, 345, 678, 901, 234, 567, 890
