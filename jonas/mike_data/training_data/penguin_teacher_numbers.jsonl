Without any visible arithmetic, geometric or other clearly defined pattern, creating a meaningful extension is speculative. If we were to make an assumption for demonstration, let's try a simple case where we observe the difference between the numbers and attempt a pattern:\n\nThe differences between the numbers are: 422 to 350 = -72, and 350 to 555 = +205.\n\nIf we average the differences, we get: (-72 + 205) \/ 2 = 66.5, rounding to 67 (for simplicity, considering positive steps).\n\nApplying this step 67 incrementally to the last number to extend the sequence:\n\n555 + 67 = 622\n622 + 67 = 689\n689 + 67 = 756\n756 + 67 = 823\n823 + 67 = 890\n890 + 67 = 957\n957 + 67 = 1024\n1024 + 67 = 1091\n1091 + 67 = 1158\n1158 + 67 = 1225\n\nTherefore, the numbers could be [622, 689, 756, 823, 890, 957, 1024, 1091, 1158, 1225].\n\nHowever, considering the question's constraint of maximum three digits, the values 1024, 1091, 1158, and 1225 exceed three digits. So, based on the three-digit constraint and the pattern we decided to apply incrementally, possible numbers are\n\n[622, 689, 756, 823, 890, 957].\n\nSo, as per requirement, the answer in the specified format is:\n\n[622, 689, 756, 823, 890, 957]"}
